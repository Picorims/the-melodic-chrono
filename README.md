# the-melodic-chrono
A minimal Android app to track by ear the time of a chrono using music notes.

## Disclaimer

The interface is ugly. The code could use some improvements regarding the use of the Android modules. The goal here was to make a minimum viable product for personal use and to practice android development a bit (without going into Fragments, LiveData, etc.). This is supposed to be a very quick side project for personal use, not a month(s) long project. That means that the app is not considered in a publishable state or production ready (the provided apk is NOT signed), and no long term maintenance is guaranteed.
